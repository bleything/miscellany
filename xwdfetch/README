I'm a crossword fanatic.  I recently got a sweet Palm Treo 650 and
promptly installed some crossword software on it.  One of the coolest
features is the ability to download puzzles from the internet.  I set
that up, but I noticed I was getting some puzzles over and over.

I had been getting my URLs from this mac app called PuzzleGetter
(http://uregina.ca/~schelled/) which uses some AppleScript magic to
fetch the correct filenames.  A lot of the sites distribute their
puzzles with the date in the URL.  Hard to do on a palm.

My solution?  Write xwdfetch.pl.  The idea is that it sits on a
webserver as a CGI.  When you request the page with a particular GET
argument, it fetches whichever crossword you asked for and forks it
over.  Pretty slick, eh?
