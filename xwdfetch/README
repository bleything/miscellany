I'm a crossword fanatic.  A while ago, I got a sweet Palm Treo 650 and
promptly installed some crossword software on it.  One of the coolest
features was the ability to download puzzles from the internet.  I set
that up, but I noticed I was getting some puzzles over and over.

I went through some ridiculous perl CGI stuff before I eventually
realized that it would be much easier to just fetch a ton of files and
stick 'em on my SD card.  The script in this directory does just that.

To run it, find a URL that has links to .puz files.  Then run it:

  ./xwdfetch.rb http://www.example.com/crosswords.html
  
Easy as pie?
