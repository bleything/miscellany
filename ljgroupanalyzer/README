This little script can be used to analyze a jbackup-generated dump and
tell you what posts have used what friends groups.  By default, listing
posts marked Friends Only is disabled.  To enable it, edit the script
and change the line:

my $ignore_fo = 1;

to

my $ignore_fo = 0;

This will cause the script to also list posts that are FO.

The only thing you need to do is use jbackup to dump your journal.
Refer to the jbackup usage doc for instructions on how.  Then simply
invoke friendanalysis.pl thusly:

./ljgroupanalyze.pl <username>

This will find the jbackup file and go to town on it.  Be warned, you
will be asked for your password.  This is done so that we can fetch the
names of the groups from the server.

If you don't want it to ask your password, try the simple analyzer:

./ljgroupanalyze-simple.pl <username>

This doesn't hit the server (and therefore doesn't require your
password) but the output is somewhat more difficult to deal with.  The
choice, as they say, is yours.

I've tried hard to make it relatively error-resistant.  Okay, that's a
lie, but someday I will.  If you find bugs or optimizations, please let
me know.
