I get a lot of spam where the subjects are lines from technical
documenation, RFCs, blog posts, and the like.  I thought it would be fun
to track where those subjects were coming from... so I give you spumble.

The idea is that you pipe an email to spumble (really, it just looks
for /^Subject: (.*)$/, so anything'll work). spumble will take that
subject line, do a Google I'm Feeling Lucky on it (in quotes, so it'll
only match the whole phrase), and if it gets a hit, post that to your
tumblr.com tumblelog.  Sound groovy?  I think so.

Enjoy :)
