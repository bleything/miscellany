This little gizmo was meant to analyze the contents of my Maildir
and notify me of duplicate messages. It accomplished this via the
oh-so-fantasmic algorithm of "strip headers, kill all whitespace, and
hash". It works okay, but I stopped using it because I have a lot of
messages that are supposed to be duplicate (notifications, etc) and the
false positive rate was dragging me down.

It requires the following perl modules be available, both of which I
believe are base:

  * File::Find
  * Digest::MD5

It is invoked thusly:

./dupifier.pl /absolute/path/to/your/Maildir

Some peculiarity of the File::Find module makes it require absolute
paths. ~/Maildir or the like may work. Your mileage, as always, may
vary.
