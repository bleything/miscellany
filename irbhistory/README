Shell-style History for irb

This file represents code written at RubyConf 2006, in preparation
for a lightning talk on adding shell-style history commands to irb.
Essentially, it adds the ability to inspect your history and re-execute
lines from the history.

In order for this to work properly, you’ll need to have one of the
various irb history hacks running. An easy option is wirble, or you
can go the traditional route and use Michael Granger’s hack from the
RubyGarden wiki.

Both of those, in one way or another, try to remove duplicate entries
from your history. Last I checked, Wirble does it wrong (doesn’t
reverse the list before running uniq so you keep the first instead
of the latest), but Michael’s version does it right. That said, I
disabled the uniq entirely because I don’t want it. IRB history will
work better without it.

To use, either copy this code into your .irbrc or place it somewhere and
require it.
