This set of toys is meant for various manipulations of IMAP
folders.  In part inspired by Eric Hodel's imapcleanse
(http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/IMAPCleanse/), which is sweet but
doesn't do quite what I want, and in part inspired by my desire to write
more pure Ruby, I've decided to write a bunch of little gizmos to help
me manage my IMAP mail better.

I should note that the eventual tool that does what imapcleanse does
doesn't exactly uhh... exist yet.  It's on the TODO list, I swear.  See?

TODO
 - Write less destructive replacement for imapcleanse

Happy now?

The only thing that's here right now is imapfolders.rb, which, as you
can imagine, calls your IMAP server up and asks what folders its got.

Problems, concerns, or generalized complaints should be sent to
http://projects.bleything.net/toys.  Money should be sent directly to
me.
