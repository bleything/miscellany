This repository includes all sorts of little toys and scripts I've
written over the years.  They're all available for public use.  Beware,
though, some of them are untested and may be dangerous or insecure or
both!  I make no claim of warranty or responsibility, so if you hose
your data with my scripts, it's your fault, not mine :)

I'm always interested in hearing feedback about my stuff, so feel free
to email me if you've got something to say.  For the forseeable future,
this project will be housed at http://projects.bleything.net/toys/ and
available via Subversion at http://svn.bleything.net/toys/

Thanks for checking it out!
