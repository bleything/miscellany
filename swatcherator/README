A small Camping app to help pick a set of colors.  Originally designed
for Timbuk2's customer messenger bags (in ballistic nylon, 2006 color
year), but can be adapted to just about anything.

To run, install camping:

 # gem install camping --include-dependencies

Then run the app:

 $ camping swatcherator.rb

Then visit http://localhost:3301 in your browser.  Ta-da!

See the code for more details.
