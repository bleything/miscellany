This is a little tool used to automate the boring day-to-day tasks that
a player in Kingdom of Loathing may want to undertake.  Currently, it
supports the following:

  * Mushroom Farming (1st-gen only)
  * Dry Noodles/Scrumptious Reagent conjuring

More to come as time (and interest) allow.

To set up the script, open it up in your favorite text editor, set
your username and password, and follow the instructions to set up your
desired actions.  Simple!

Disclaimer: I'm not responsible for anything you screw up while using
this.  I'm using it myself, so I'm suffering too.

KNOWN ISSUES

  * Attempting to plant mushrooms in slots that already have spores will
    result in picking (and wasting) those spores.  See Ticket #2 for
    more.
